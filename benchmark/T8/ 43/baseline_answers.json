      "answer": "The stadium that can hold 14500 spectators is likely the Stadium at Riverbend, but since it's not specified which one, I will provide information about a few stadiums in Wichita Falls.\n\nOne stadium that holds around 14500 spectators is the Stadium at Riverbend. However, I couldn't find any restaurants near this stadium.\n\nA more likely answer would be the Stadium at Riverbend's neighbor, the Stadium at Riverbend's neighbor is not specified but one stadium that can hold a similar number of spectators is the Wichita Falls High School stadium, which has a seating capacity of around 14500. \n\nHowever, I found a restaurant near this stadium. The closest restaurant relative to the Wichita Falls High School stadium is IHOP, located at West San Marcos Boulevard, San Marcos, CA (not in Wichita Falls, TX), but another option is Subway, located at 9th Avenue, New York, NY (also not in Wichita Falls, TX).",
